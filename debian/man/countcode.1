.SH NAME
countcode \- counts per known source file type the number of source lines
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcountcode\fP [\-h] [\-b] [\-c] [\-s] [\-l] [\-p PRINTLEVEL] [\-d] [\-t] [\-v] [directory]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcountcode\fP counts per known source file type the number of source lines
in the files in the given directory and recursively in its
subdirectories.  It supports many file types. The type is recognized
from the file name extension or the shebang script type. Use -s to see
all supported types.
 
The following line types are counted:

  code:     pure code lines
  comment:  pure comment lines
  blank:    empty lines or lines containing whitespace only
  header:   the copyright header (leading comment lines)
  other:    all other lines
  
Unless \fB-b\fR is given, a pure code or comment line has to contain
an alphanumeric character; e.g., a single } does not count as code
line.  It calculates the percentage of code and comment lines in the
total number of lines or (if \fB-l\fR is given) in the sum of code and
comment lines.  Unless \fB-t\fR is given, files in test directories
are counted separately.  Normal output is written on stdout; verbose
on stderr.  Files with an unknown type are reported on stderr.  Note
that \fB-bt\fR should give about the same results as a tool like cloc.
