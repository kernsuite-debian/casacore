Note: The files install/printer/{range.c,lwf_a.c} document a non-DFSG
 compatible license. Ole Streicher contacted the author (Barry
 Brachman <brachman@dss.ca>) and got the permission from him to
 distribute the file as LGPL-2+ and to remove or change the copyright
 note in the file, quoted:
 .
 You have my permission to re-release your version of range.c under
 the LGPL-2 if you prefer.  It is sufficient for me if you either
 remove the old copyright notice entirely or add a note to the code
 that the old license has been revoked by the author (me) and changed
 to the LGPL - whichever you like.  If you want to add a copyright
 notice, it may read:
 .
     /* Copyright (c) 1985-2012 Distributed Systems Software */
 .
 But I don't require you to add a copyright notice.
 .
 [...]
 .
 You also have my permission to change the license & copyright for lwf_c.c
 in the same way as for range.c
 .
 The license change is reported to upstream.
