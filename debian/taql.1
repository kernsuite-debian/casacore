\fBtaql\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The Table Query Language (TaQL) is an SQL-like high level language
to do operations like selection, sort, and update on a casacore
table. It is a very versatile language with full support for table
columns containing array data. It has inherent support for masked
arrays, units, and astronomical coordinates. It has a very rich set of
functions (like cone search and array reduction) making it very
suitable for astronomical applications. User defined functions can be
added easily. It also has full support of grouping/aggregation and
nested queries. An operation that can be expressed in a single
function is the matching of two sky catalogues.
.PP
\fBtaql\fP can be started with multiple arguments containing options and
an optional \fBTaQL\fP command as the last argument.  It will run
interactively if no \fBTaQL\fP command is given. If possible,
interactive commands are kept in $HOME/.taql\d\s-2history\s+2\u for later
reuse.
.PP
A binding in C++, Python, and Glish is available.
