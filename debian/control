Description: Common Astronomy Software Applications core library
 The casacore package contains the core libraries of the old AIPS++/CASA
 package. This split was made to get a better separation of core libraries and
 applications. CASA is now built on top of casacore.
 .
 The system consists of a set of layered libraries (packages) which can be
 seen best on the Modules page. A Python binding to the libraries has been
 made which is called pyrap.
